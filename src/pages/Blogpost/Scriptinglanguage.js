                            The scripting language is basically a language where instructions are written for a run time environment. They do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. It brings new functions to applications and glue complex system together. A scripting language is a language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages.

                            The benefit of client-side scripts is that they can reduce demand on the server, allowing web pages to load faster.</p>
